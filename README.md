A team project creating a food review website that shows the top rated Japanese restaurants in London. We fetched the data using the Zomato API. The look of the website is inspired by Foodora.

## How we did it

We started out with the whole team, all eight of us together to go over the project and create a plan. Then we divided the team up to two four-people teams. When the time was getting tight one from each team broke off into a styling team so that the website would be presentable.
